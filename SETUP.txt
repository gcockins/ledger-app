# Ledger — Setup Instructions
## Get this running on your desktop in 5 minutes

---

## What You Need First
- A computer (Mac or Windows)
- Node.js installed (free) — download at https://nodejs.org
  → Click the "LTS" version (the left button), install it like any normal program
  → To check it worked: open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows) and type:
      node --version
    You should see something like: v20.0.0

---

## Step 1 — Copy the project folder
Put the `ledger-app` folder somewhere you'll remember, like your Desktop or Documents.

---

## Step 2 — Open Terminal in that folder

**On Mac:**
1. Open Terminal (search "Terminal" in Spotlight)
2. Type: cd Desktop/ledger-app  (or wherever you put it)
3. Press Enter

**On Windows:**
1. Open the ledger-app folder in File Explorer
2. Click the address bar at the top, type "cmd", press Enter
3. A Command Prompt window opens in that folder

---

## Step 3 — Install (one time only)
Type this and press Enter. Wait for it to finish (takes 1-2 minutes):

    npm install

You'll see a lot of text scroll by — that's normal. Wait until you see your cursor again.

---

## Step 4 — Run the app
Every time you want to use it, type:

    npm start

Your browser will open automatically with the app at http://localhost:3000
To stop it: press Ctrl+C in the terminal window.

---

## Your Data
- All your financial data is saved in your browser's local storage
- It stays on YOUR computer — never sent anywhere
- Use the "Export Backup" button regularly to save a .json backup file
- Use "Restore Backup" to bring data back from that file

## Troubleshooting

"npm is not recognized" — Node.js isn't installed. Go to nodejs.org and install it.
"Port 3000 already in use" — another app is running on that port. Close it or type: npm start -- --port 3001
App won't load — try refreshing the browser, or stop and restart with npm start

## Want to share it with someone else?
Just zip up the ledger-app folder and send it.
They install Node.js, run npm install, then npm start — same steps as above.
